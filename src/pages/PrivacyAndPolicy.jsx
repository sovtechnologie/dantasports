                        Users must provide specific SPDI, such as their credit card or debit card information, when creating an account on the platform. Payment gateways and financial institutions need this information in order to complete transactions.

Instead, the payment gateway obtains these SPDIs directly through an interaction with our platform. Depending on how a user interacts with the platform, several types of information are gathered. Danta Sports promises to adhere to reasonable security measures and procedures in order to safeguard the information you supply. Without your prior consent, Danta Sports agrees not to transfer or divulge your SPDI to a third party for any reason.
